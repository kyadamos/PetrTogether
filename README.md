# PetrTogether

PetrTogether is a program intended to assist professors and teachers in assigning students in larger classrooms to groups with the hopes of consistently assembling effective and collaborative team environments that will provide a beneficial educational experience to each of the teams' students. At UCI, around 50-100 fourth and fifth year mechanical engineering majors enroll in their senior design/capstone courses per quarter; during each first week, they attend an hour long presentation to learn about the 10-15 available projects, and then they complete a ~20 question survey in which they estimate their interests, experience, availability, course performance, etc. By the next week, each of these 50-100 students would be placed into their senior design project, where they can only hope that they learn and thrive.


My professor has been assigning these students to their projects by hand and mostly, if not all, by himself for the past year and a half now. He's a huge optimization fan, so when he explained the problem to me (it took a few times), I thought it was hilarious and very on-brand of him to mention his "objective function", as well as the several constraints he faces.

Similar software exists already, such as [CATME](https://www.catme.org/login/index), a program with a strong focus on the teamwork, behavioral, and management aspects of the problem, or Dr. Jack McGourty's [Team Developer](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.539.868&rep=rep1&type=pdf) from the early 2000s, which also aims to provide a nurturing yet competitive learning experience for their students, particularly in management and partly in engineering. On the surface level, my intentions with PetrTogether are to increase my knowledge of programming and optimization; on a deeper level, I'm interested in learning more about engineering education and how we may be able to expose more to the intrinsic value in the field that some unfortunately don't see.














everybody has different interests, goals, strengths, and struggles.
	
	a lot of the time, we work together with other people: coworkers, teammates, friends, or family. and whether we're working on a school project, planning a surprise party, assigning people to teams, or running a business, it can get overwhelming trying to figure out what everybody should do so that we can maximize everyone's happiness, or at least minimize costs.

	like when your group's year-long project is supposed to be competition-ready in a month but you're only halfway done, or you're feeling like quitting your management position because you misplaced your employees and nobody seems motivated to work, or you're grinding out hours on league to figure out which playstyle works the best with your high school friends because you're hoping they'll let you play with them again.

	sorry.

	
	
	



	able to put some quantifiable information on a spreadsheet about:

	a) what tasks they usually like
	b) what they're good at
	c) what they want to learn more about
	d) how long it will take them to do something
	e) how far away they live from the place
	f) how many hours they'll probably spend doing it
	g) how much it will cost for that person to do it
	h) how much you stand to gain if that person does it
	i-z) whatever else you is relevant to making your decisions

then hopefully this could help you. i'm not a super great programmer, but it's definitely one of the more fun and fulfilling projects i've been working on; if you have any tips or any questions, shoot me an email or a dm :)
